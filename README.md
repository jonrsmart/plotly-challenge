This homework assignment required me to utilize a JSON file of data to dyanamically update the following: 
- Dropdown Menu
![Dropdown Menu](images/dropdown.png)
- Plotly Bar Chart
![Plotly Bar Chart](../images/bar-chart.png)
- Plotly Gauge Chart
![Plotly Gauge Chart](images\gauge-chart.png)
- Plotly Bubble Chart
![Plotly Bubble Chart](images\bubble-chart.png)
- Test Subject Demographic Information
![Demographic Information](images\demographic.png)

In addition to requirements, I added a dynamic title to all charts that populations the test subject's ID in the title. 

The page was then deployed to GitHub pages at: [https://jonrsmart.github.io/plotly-challenge/]
